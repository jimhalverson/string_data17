# Breakout Group: Introduction to Networks

# What is Network Science?
Network science uses graph theory, statistics and probability theory, data mining, and information visualization to allow us to *predict* and *control* the behavior of the real-world networks we encounter.

# What will we learn?
We will study several topics in this breakout group:
1. *Models of random and real networks*
2. *Common structural properties of graphs*
3. *Diffusion processes across networks*
4. *Models of infection spreading*

# What do you need to be prepared?
This tutorial uses ipython notebooks with the python-igraph library. You will need to have both installed to run the code.
*ipython* - https://ipython.org/install.html
*igraph* - http://igraph.org/python/

# Discussion questions
1. What objects in string theory can be modeled as graphs, i.e., a collection of objects with relations? What about as statistical ensembles of graphs?
2. On the string landscape, what types of diffusion processes can you imagine occuring? Ideas for toy models?
3. What
